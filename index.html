            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                Plankton serves as a critical indicator of aquatic ecosystem health due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and short life cycles. The integration of AI technologies and high-speed imaging instruments presents an exciting opportunity to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of plankton monitoring. In this project, we are utilizing data from the <a href="https://www.planktonanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Plankton Imaging (Pi-10) instrument</a> deployed on the <a href="https://www.cefas.co.uk/about-us/facilities/rv-cefas-endeavour/" target="_blank">RV Cefas Endeavour</a> to develop a near real-time monitoring application using state-of-the-art AI techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building on the work of the Turing Data Study Group (DSG), we aim to enhance the DSG classifier for the real-time access to plankton imager data (RAPID) toolset, which is designed for the Plankton Analytics Pi-10 instrument. The first version of the RAPID Plankton software was operational within six months and deployed on the RV Cefas Endeavour. This open-source software can be adapted to classify images of various marine species and objects, revolutionizing the study of marine ecosystems. Further developments include the deployment of a <a href="https://planktonapi-dev.cefastest.co.uk" target="_blank">real-time dashboard</a> to provide continuous plankton metrics. Additionally, we are implementing explainable AI (xAI) methods to enhance collaboration with ecologists, making AI models more transparent and interpretable.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of this effort, we are also introducing <strong>ViT-LASNet</strong>, a comprehensive framework designed to improve the classification of plankton images from the Pi-10 dataset, particularly for real-time applications. ViT-LASNet integrates advanced image classification architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViT) and BEiT, combined with a novel dynamic Label-Aware Smoothing (LAS) strategy. This approach aims to significantly enhance plankton classification accuracy and support the broader goal of real-time ecological monitoring.
